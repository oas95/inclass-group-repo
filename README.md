This repository includes our submission for UTA Data Analysis and Visualizaiton Bootcamp - Project #1. Our project consists of an analysis of data on over 130,000 different wines, including a review and score from a professional sommelier, and our analysis centers around the questions:


         1. What wine has the best value (highest rating for lowest price)?
         2. What countries produce the highest quality and highest price wines?
         3. What are the different ways in which wine can be described and how do these descriptions affect price?
         4. What different names of fruits are used most commonly in reviews in general and by country?

Wine Analysis Conclusion
___________________________________________________________

- Great wine is possible to purchase for as little as $4
- Spending over $43 on wine is generally not worth it as scoring in the $26 to $42 range is comparable 
- The top 5 highest scored countries are England(91.22), India(90.22), Austria(90.20), Germany(89.84), and Canada(89.37).
- Top 5 most expensive countries Switzerland($85.29), England($51.68), Germany($42.45), Italy($41.61), and France($41.19)
- No significant difference mean in flavor profile value and body scale value for different price levels
- Appears that the most wines extreme in flavor or body are generally the cheapest
- If you want berry flavors, import from Israel. If you're more into stone fruits, you could honestly shop anywhere, but they're the most common in Bulgaria. If citrus is your thing, check out German wine. If you're open to a variety of fruity experiences, check out Hungarian wine.
