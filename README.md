This repository includes our submission for UTA Data Analysis and Visualizaiton Bootcamp - Project #1. Our project consists of an analysis of data on over 130,000 different wines, including a review and score from a professional sommelier, and our analysis centers around the questions:


         1. What wine has the best value (highest rating for lowest price)?
         2. What countries produce the highest quality and highest price wines?
         3. What are the different ways in which wine can be described and how do these descriptions affect price?
         4. What different names of fruits are used most commonly in reviews in general and by country?
